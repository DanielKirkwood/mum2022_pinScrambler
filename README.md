# mum2022_pinScrambler

A prototype made by University of Glasgow students and their course lecturers of a authentication system that can decrease the effectiveness of shoulder surfing attacks and thermal imaging attack.
The app is built in react-native allowing us to deploy it to both iOS and Android devices.

## Installation

### Android

- To install to your Android device first ensure that you have allowed application from unknown developers in your settings.
- Then simply download the 'pin_scrambler_v1.0.0.apk' package found in the releases section of this GitHub repo.
- Open the downloaded file and install it

### Instructions

- Login to the app using the user id given to you by the experiment lead.
- once logged in you can set your PIN up by clicking the 'set your pin' button. If you need to change your pin later on you can click this same button.
- attempt to unlock the device by using the PIN you just set. The application will measure the time it takes you to successfully unlock the device and the number errors you make in doing so.
- you can change the ordering layout of the pin inputs in the unlocked screen. Your experiment leader will tell you when to do so however it should be noted that by default users with an even id will automatically be given the random layout when they first login.
- after you have completed any/all tasks given you can click the 'download as CSV' button in the unlocked screen which will download any recorded data to a csv file in your downloads.
- please provide this file to your experiment lead.

**if you wish to start fresh or remove any saved data there is a button to do so in the unlocked screen**
